Starsurfing is a full-stack web application inspired by the Couchsurfing website. It allows users to create profiles and send requests to other users to stay at their place, with absolutely no monetary cost. Starsurfing is a futuristic twist on the original concept, with users visiting users from other stars, instead of other cities.

This project was implemented with a Ruby on Rails backend, and was written with React.js and Redux.

## Project Design
I completed Starsurfing over the course of two weeks. Before starting, I completed a project outline including a feature list, wireframes, a component hierarchy, a projected sample state, predicted routes, and expected database schema.
