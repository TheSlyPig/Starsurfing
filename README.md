# Starsurfing

Starsurfing is a full-stack web application inspired by the Couchsurfing website. It allows users to create profiles and send requests to other users to stay at their place, with absolutely no monetary cost. Starsurfing is a futuristic twist on the original concept, with users visiting users from other stars, instead of other cities.

This project was implemented with a Ruby on Rails backend, using React.js and Redux.

## Features & Implementation

* User account creation, including uploading of profile images

* User authentication using BCrypt

* Splash page, with an index of all stars that have hosts

* Show page for each star, featuring Google Maps integration and an index of users at that star

* Review functionality, allowing users to Create Read Update and Destroy reviews.

## Project Design
I completed Starsurfing over the course of two weeks. Before starting, I completed a project outline including a [feature list](https://github.com/TheSlyPig/star-surfing/wiki/MVP-List), [wireframes](https://github.com/TheSlyPig/star-surfing/wiki/Wireframes), a [component hierarchy](https://github.com/TheSlyPig/star-surfing/wiki/Component-Hierarchy), a projected [sample state](https://github.com/TheSlyPig/star-surfing/wiki/Sample-State), [routes](https://github.com/TheSlyPig/star-surfing/wiki/Routes), and expected [database schema](https://github.com/TheSlyPig/star-surfing/wiki/Database-Schema).
